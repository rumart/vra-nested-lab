# vra-nested-lab

This repository holds the Powershell scripts and vRO workflows that are used in my project for deploying a nested vSphere lab environment with vRealize Automation.

The vRO workflows are available as standalone workflows, but note that some of them depend on other workflows and actions. There is also a vRO package in the repo that should take care of those dependencies.

For more information about the project visit my [blog](https://rudimartinsen.com/vra-nested-lab)
